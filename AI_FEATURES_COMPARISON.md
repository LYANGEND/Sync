## 💬 Example Interactions

### Student Using AI Teacher
```
Student: "Explain photosynthesis"

AI Teacher: 
"Great question! Let me explain photosynthesis step by step! 🌱

[DEFINITION: Photosynthesis] 
The process plants use to make food using sunlight!

Here's how it works:
[STEP 1: Sunlight] Plants absorb sunlight through leaves
[STEP 2: Water] Roots take in water from soil
[STEP 3: Carbon Dioxide] Leaves take in CO2 from air
[STEP 4: Magic!] Plants combine these to make food (glucose)

[Diagram showing the process]
