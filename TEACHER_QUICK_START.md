# Teacher Quick Start Guide

## Welcome, Teachers! 👋

This guide will help you navigate the Sync LMS platform and understand the difference between your Teacher Dashboard and the AI Teacher tool.

## 🎯 Two Different Areas

### 1. **Teacher Dashboard** (Your Main Workspace)
**URL**: `/` (homepage after login)

This is YOUR main workspace where you manage your teaching activities:

#### What You Can Do:
- ✅ View today's class schedule
- ✅ Take attendance for your classes
- ✅ Create and assign homework
- ✅ Grade student submissions
- ✅ Upload teaching resources
- ✅ Manage video lessons
- ✅ View gradebook and student progress
- ✅ Post announcements
- ✅ Communicate with students and parents
- ✅ View your classes and students

#### How to Access:
- Click **"Dashboard"** in the sidebar (top item)
- Or navigate to the homepage: `/`
- This is where you land after logging in

---

### 2. **AI Teacher** (Student Tutoring Tool)
**URL**: `/ai-teacher`

This is an AI-powered tutoring assistant designed FOR STUDENTS, not for teachers to use as their main workspace.

#### What It Does:
- Provides personalized tutoring to students
- Answers student questions about subjects
- Explains concepts with diagrams and examples
- Conducts interactive lessons
- Helps with homework (doesn't give answers, teaches concepts)

#### When Teachers Use It:
- To test how the AI explains concepts to students
- To see what kind of help students are getting
- To understand the AI's teaching approach
- To provide feedback on AI responses

#### Important Note:
**This is NOT your teacher dashboard!** If you see "Hi Teacher! I'm your AI Teacher" with a message about selecting subjects, you're in the wrong place. Click the link to go back to your Teacher Dashboard.
